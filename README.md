# Calculator app

![Design preview for the Calculator app coding challenge](/public/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution.

The challenge is aiming to build out a calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

## Continued development

I was looking for a basic theme system thatâ€™s easy to set up and work with. The solution I liked centered around using CSS variables and data attributes. The thing I'd like to improve is having the initial theme preference checked and save any additional changes in the browser. I am using Nextjs with the default config, so itâ€™s pregenerating all of the HTML into static pages, I found some intresting solutions but only designed for client side rendering as a Single Page Application.
